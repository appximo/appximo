# AGENTS.md — Appitools

Instructions for AI coding agents. Part 1 is for working **on this repo**
(contributing to the engine). The [Integration guide](#integration-guide--helping-a-user-adopt-appitools)
is for the other job: helping a user adopt Appitools in **their** project.
Every syntax claim in this file is audited against the engine source
(`pkg/schema`, `pkg/query`, `pkg/graphql`) — do not invent API surface
beyond what is listed here.

## What this is

Appitools compiles a JSON schema into a multi-tenant REST + GraphQL +
OpenAPI server **at boot** — Go 1.25, no CGO, one static binary,
PostgreSQL with schema-per-tenant isolation. There are no handlers,
models, or migration files to write: routes, SQL, validation, RBAC and
OpenAPI are derived from the schema at startup (`pkg/codegen.BuildRouter`),
and tables are created/extended idempotently when a tenant registers.

**If a task looks like "add an endpoint / model / migration", it is
almost always "add a resource or field to the schema JSON".** Code
changes are for engine behavior, not application surface.

## Commands

```bash
make build            # go build ./...
make test             # unit lane: -race -short, no Docker needed, ~7 s warm
make test-all         # + integration + e2e + resilience — needs Docker (testcontainers)
make test-integration # DB-backed suite alone (Docker)
make test-e2e         # full client scenarios (Docker)
make lint             # golangci-lint run ./...
go test -run 'TestBuildQuery' -race ./pkg/query/   # one test
```

Boot the engine locally (needs a reachable Postgres):

```bash
go build -o appitools ./cmd/appitools
DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db' \
JWT_SECRET='a-secret-of-at-least-32-characters' ADMIN_KEY='dev-admin' \
  ./appitools serve --schema examples/quickstart/schema.json --port 8080
```

- All three env vars are hard-required — `serve` exits without them.
- Do NOT use `make run` / `go run ./cmd/appitools/main.go`: passing the
  file compiles *only* `main.go`, producing a binary with **zero
  subcommands** (no `serve`). Use the package path:
  `go run ./cmd/appitools serve …`.
- Other subcommands: `validate <schema>`, `token` (mint a dev JWT),
  `openapi`, `graphql` (SDL), `generate`, `migrate`, `backup`, `init`,
  `blueprints list` (lists schema files in a local `blueprints/` dir),
  `version` (prints the ldflags-injected build version; "dev" on a plain
  local build — releases and published images carry their tag).
- `tools/devhub/` is a local dev dashboard (systemd service on :3099).
  It is **not part of the engine** — never ship engine features there.
  `make devhub-run` is only for developing the devhub itself (stop the
  service first or :3099 is taken and the stale binary keeps serving).

## Conventions (this repo, non-obvious)

- SQLite is always `modernc.org/sqlite`, never `mattn/go-sqlite3` — the
  project is CGO-free end to end (same reason it uses Goja and Wazero,
  not v8 or native plugins).
- Compile work at schema load, never per request: regexes (RE2),
  validation rules (`pkg/schema/rules.go`), enum sets. The request path
  only executes precompiled closures.
- SQL identifiers go through `pgx.Identifier.Sanitize()`; values are
  always bound parameters; `search_path` is set only as `SET LOCAL`
  inside a transaction.
- The tenant comes from the Host header subdomain (`acme.example.com` →
  Postgres schema `tenant_acme`). It is a naming convention — the
  middleware does no tenant-table lookup.
- Validation is declarative in the schema (S44), not code in handlers.
  New validation capabilities go into `pkg/schema/rules.go` +
  `validator.go` so REST and GraphQL share them.
- Postgres errors are masked before reaching client response bodies.
- Linear git history on `main` — rebase, no merge commits.
- Secrets never enter git: `.env.example` is the template, real values
  live in `.env` (gitignored).
- Performance-sensitive engine changes are measured, not eyeballed:
  `make bench-protocol RUNS=10 LABEL=my-change` (warmup + N runs +
  statistical verdict; see `scripts/bench-protocol.sh`).

## Boundaries — do not

- **Never pin a security-relevant dependency downward.** CI runs
  govulncheck and blocks the build. Real incident: x/crypto pinned to
  v0.48 reintroduced GO-2026-5013 and broke the release.
- **Never `pkill -f` / `pgrep -f`** — `-f` matches the invoking shell's
  own command line, so it self-matches and can kill your own session.
  Use `-x <exact-binary-name>` or an explicit PID.
- Never expose the control plane (`:9090`) to the internet. It is the
  tenant-registration API, designed to stay on localhost / the internal
  network, gated only by `X-Admin-Key`.
- Never change a README feature or performance claim without
  re-verifying it against the running engine — every claim there was
  audited line by line before launch; keep that property.
- `testdata/` and `examples/logistics-api/` are test fixtures. The
  canonical public example is `examples/quickstart/schema.json`
  (`todo-api`, one `tasks` resource) — keep docs consistent with it and
  do not surface guides/logistics in user-facing material.

## Architecture orientation

One line per layer — navigate the code for the rest:

- `pkg/schema` — schema parsing, load-time validation, rule compilation.
- `pkg/codegen` — `BuildRouter`: builds the live chi router from the
  schema at boot. (`internal/handlers/` + the `generate` subcommand are
  the older write-files generator, kept for template tests.)
- `pkg/query` — URL params → validated SQL: filters, sort, keyset pagination.
- `pkg/graphql` — schema → GraphQL types and resolvers (queries + create/delete).
- `pkg/rbac` — JSON policies; row conditions appended via `query.AppendRowCondition`
  (shared by REST and GraphQL — fix authorization bugs there, once).
- `pkg/tenant` — Host-subdomain resolution + per-tenant schema cache.
- `pkg/extensions` — hooks: Goja JS sandbox, Wazero WASM, webhook dispatcher.
- `pkg/events` — SSE hub, post-commit fan-out.
- `pkg/migration` — idempotent DDL (`CREATE TABLE / ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`).
- `pkg/outbox` — transactional outbox (ADR-016 §Class 2): `Enqueue` writes a job
  in the caller's tx and emits `pg_notify(outbox_notify, <id>)` on commit.
- `pkg/worker` — the outbox consumer behind the SEPARATE `cmd/appitools-worker`
  binary (not a goroutine in the engine): LISTEN/NOTIFY wake-up + poll fallback,
  `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, at-least-once (Processors must be idempotent).
  Run it with `DATABASE_URL=… go run ./cmd/appitools-worker`; the end-to-end proof
  is `scripts/worker-e2e.sh`.

Request flow: tenant (Host) → rate limit → response cache → JWT → RBAC →
handler (`pkg/codegen`) → query build / validation → hooks → pgx →
serialize. The SSE endpoint bypasses the response cache; other GETs flow
through it (so a "stale read" bug report usually means cache invalidation,
not the query).

## Commits & PRs

Conventional Commits, one logical change per commit: `feat:` `fix:`
`docs:` `test:` `chore:` `refactor:` (details in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)). License is Apache 2.0; contributions
are licensed under it — no separate CLA/DCO. PR gate: `go build ./...`,
`make test`, golangci-lint clean, and schema changes validated with
`appitools validate`.

# Integration guide — helping a user adopt Appitools

This half is for when a user wants Appitools to serve **their** API and
you are writing their schema and calling their endpoints. The surface
below is complete and verified — if something is not listed, the engine
does not support it (see [Does not exist](#does-not-exist--do-not-invent)).

## Writing a schema

One JSON file. `$schema` and `version` are **required** (load fails
without them). A complete, working example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://appitools.dev/schema/v1",
  "version": "1",
  "name": "todo-api",
  "resources": {
    "tasks": {
      "fields": {
        "title":  { "type": "string", "required": true, "maxLength": 200 },
        "status": { "type": "string", "enum": ["open", "done"] },
        "due":    { "type": "time" }
      }
    }
  },
  "rbac": {
    "roles": {
      "admin":  { "resources": "*", "actions": ["*"] },
      "viewer": { "resources": ["tasks"], "actions": ["read"], "fields": ["id", "title", "status"] }
    }
  }
}
```

Naming rules (enforced at load): resource names `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`,
field names `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`. An `id` UUID primary key is implicit —
don't declare it. The validator is **strict about keys**: any key
outside the documented surface — at any level — rejects the schema with
an error listing the valid keys for that level, so typos never become
silently dead config.

### Field types — the complete set

| `type` | Postgres column | Filter ops available |
|---|---|---|
| `string`, `text` | TEXT | `eq`, `partial` (`ILIKE %v%`), `start` (`ILIKE v%`) |
| `int`, `int64`, `float64` | INTEGER / BIGINT / DOUBLE PRECISION | `eq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte` |
| `time` | TIMESTAMPTZ | `eq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `after`, `before` |
| `uuid` | UUID | `eq` |
| `bool` | BOOLEAN | `eq` |
| `json` | TEXT (stored as text) | none — not filterable |

### Field keys

- `required: true` — NOT NULL column; must be present on POST and PUT
  (PATCH validates only the fields sent).
- `unique: true` — UNIQUE constraint.
- `auto: true` — engine-managed `TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()` (for
  `created_at` / `updated_at`); exempt from the required check.
- `enum: ["a", "b"]` — string values only; writes outside the set → 422.
- `relation: "<resource>"` — see [Relations](#relations).
- Validation rules (all optional, compiled at load; a bad rule rejects
  the schema with a clear error):
  - numeric fields: `min`, `max`
  - string/text fields: `minLength` / `maxLength` (rune count),
    `pattern` (RE2 regex, ≤ 200 chars), `format` — exactly one of
    `email | uuid | url | date`

A write that violates rules returns **422 with every failing field at
once**: `{"error":"validation_failed","fields":[{"field":"title","rule":"required","message":"is required"}]}`.

### Relations

```json
"customer_id": { "type": "uuid", "relation": "customers" }
```

generates one read-only route — `GET /api/orders/{id}/customer` (field
name minus `_id`) — returning the referenced record. That is **all**
`relation` does: no FK constraint, no joins in list queries, no nested
writes, no cascade.

### RBAC

Actions are exactly `read | create | update | delete | "*"`. **Deny by
default**: a role with no matching policy gets 403; a record excluded by
a row condition reads as 404 (not 403).

```json
"rbac": {
  "roles": {
    "admin":    { "resources": "*", "actions": ["*"] },
    "operator": {
      "resources": ["tasks"],
      "actions": ["read", "update"],
      "fields": ["id", "title", "status"],
      "conditions": { "field": "operator_id", "op": "eq", "val": "$user_id" }
    }
  }
}
```

`fields` is a response allowlist; `conditions` filters rows, with
`$user_id` resolving to the JWT subject. The JWT `role` claim selects
the policy.

### Hooks (lifecycle extensions)

Declared per resource under `hooks`. Events are exactly
`before_create | after_create | before_update | after_update` — there
are **no delete hooks**, and any other event name is rejected at
validation. Three hook types (all fields below verified against
`pkg/schema/types.go`):

```json
"hooks": {
  "before_create": {
    "type": "js",
    "script": "if (!data.title) { result.proceed = false; result.error = 'title required'; }"
  },
  "after_create": {
    "type": "webhook",
    "url": "https://erp.example.com/webhooks/task-created",
    "hmac_secret_env": "WEBHOOK_SECRET_TASKS"
  }
}
```

- `js` — Goja sandbox, watchdog-interrupted (80 ms soft / 500 ms hard).
  `data` is the record; setting `result.proceed = false` +
  `result.error` rejects the write with 422. Built-ins available:
  `validateNIT`, `calculateCUFE`, `isValidEmail`, `formatMoney`.
- `webhook` — async signed POST: headers `X-Appitools-Event` and
  `X-Appitools-Signature: sha256=<hmac>`; 3 retries with backoff.
  **`hmac_secret_env` is the NAME of an env var holding the secret**,
  not the secret itself (a `"secret"` key does not exist). Constraints
  that are easy to trip on: the dispatcher is **HTTPS-only and
  SSRF-guarded in every environment** — `http://` URLs and
  loopback/private/link-local IPs are refused (logged, never delivered),
  so a local/LAN receiver will never get called; test against a public
  HTTPS endpoint.
- `wasm` — `wasm_module` (pre-loaded module name) + `wasm_fn` (default
  `transform`), Wazero, 16 MiB limit.

**Hooks are compiled at boot from the `--schema` file** (same as routes
and GraphQL types). Declaring or changing hooks through the control
plane (`PUT /tenants/{id}/schema` + reload) does NOT wire them — the
reload response says so in a `warnings` field; a process restart is
required.

### Events (opt-in outbox emission)

A resource may opt into emitting a **transactional outbox event** on each
generated CRUD write by declaring an `events` array at the resource level
(sibling of `fields`/`hooks`):

```json
"tasks": {
  "fields": { "title": { "type": "string", "required": true } },
  "events": ["create", "update", "delete"]
}
```

- Values are exactly `create | update | delete` (present tense, the RBAC
  action vocabulary). Any other value rejects the schema at load. A
  resource that omits `events` emits nothing and pays **zero overhead** on
  the write path.
- The event is written to `public.outbox` **in the same transaction** as
  the CRUD write (`pkg/outbox`): if the write rolls back (e.g. a unique
  violation), the event never exists — and vice-versa. The engine fires
  `pg_notify(outbox_notify, <id>)` on commit; the separate
  `cmd/appitools-worker` consumes it (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`,
  at-least-once, idempotent).
- **Topic** is `{resource}.{created|updated|deleted}` — e.g. a POST to
  `tasks` emits `tasks.created`, PUT/PATCH `tasks.updated`, DELETE
  `tasks.deleted`. (PUT and PATCH both map to `updated`.)
- **Payload** is lean — `{"id", "tenant_id", "resource", "action"}` (the
  affected row's id + identity, never the full row). A consumer that needs
  more does its own `SELECT`; for a delete the row is already gone, so the
  id is all the event carries.
- A delete that matches no row (404) emits nothing.

## Running it and making the first call

Fastest path is the published Docker image — the four copy-paste
commands (register tenant → mint JWT → POST → filtered GET) are in the
[README quick start](README.md#quick-start-30-s-with-the-image-pull);
the production/TLS path is [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md). Don't
re-derive those commands — they are verified verbatim.

Facts agents most often get wrong:

- **Tenant = Host header.** Every data-plane request needs
  `Host: acme.localhost` (or a real subdomain). Host of a different
  tenant → 401 `token tenant mismatch`; Host with no subdomain (bare
  IP/`localhost`) → 500 with empty body.
- **JWT**: HS256 only, `exp` required, `role` claim must match a schema
  role. Mint dev tokens with
  `appitools token --secret "$JWT_SECRET" --tenant acme --role admin`.
- **Two ports**: data plane `:8080`; control plane `:9090` (tenant
  registration via `X-Admin-Key`) — internal only, never proxied.
- **Health probes (all unauthenticated)**: `/healthz` (liveness, never
  touches Postgres), `/readyz` (readiness — flips to **503** while
  draining on SIGTERM), `/health` (returns `{"status":"ok","version":…}`
  with the build version). By contrast `/metrics` and `/debug/*` are
  admin-gated — the deep observability surface is mapped in
  [docs/EXPLORE.md](docs/EXPLORE.md).
- `/metrics` and `/debug/*` require `X-Admin-Key` even though the routes
  exist on the public listener.
- curl needs `-g` for filter brackets: `curl -g '...?filter[status][eq]=open'`.

## Calling the REST API — exact syntax

Per resource `tasks`: `GET|POST /api/tasks`,
`GET|PUT|PATCH|DELETE /api/tasks/{id}`, `GET /api/tasks/events` (SSE,
JWT + RBAC enforced, fields/rows filtered at delivery), plus relation
subroutes.

- **Filters**: `?filter[field]=v` (implies `eq`) or
  `?filter[field][op]=v` with ops from the type table above. Unknown
  field or type-incompatible op → 400.
- **Search**: `?search=term` runs a case-insensitive substring match
  (`ILIKE %term%`, `%`/`_` escaped) across **only** the resource's
  `string` and `text` fields, OR-ed together and AND-ed with any
  filters. It does **not** touch `int`/`int64`/`float64`/`time`/`uuid`/
  `bool`/`json` fields, and it is a no-op (ignored) on a resource with no
  string/text fields. It is a plain `ILIKE`, not a ranked/full-text
  search engine.
- **Sort**: `?sort=field&order=asc|desc` — **one field only**. The
  alternative `?order[field]=desc` also works and wins when both are
  sent. Anything else (`sort=field:desc`, multi-field) is **silently
  ignored** — verify result order, don't trust the param.
- **Pagination**: keyset — `?after=<uuid>` / `?before=<uuid>` with
  `?per_page=` (default 20, max 100). `?page=` exists but is
  OFFSET-based; prefer keyset.
- Responses are `{"data": [...], "meta": {...}}`.

## GraphQL

`POST /graphql`. Queries plus `create<Singular>` / `delete<Singular>`
mutations only (e.g. `createTask`, `deleteTask`) — **no update
mutation**; use REST PUT/PATCH. GraphQL always answers **HTTP 200**:
check the `errors` array in the body, never the status code. Validation
failures arrive as `errors[].extensions.fields` (same rule engine as
REST). Introspection is disabled in production (the `__schema`/`__type`
fields are rejected outside development; `__typename` is allowed);
GraphiQL only runs with `APPITOOLS_ENV=development`. The query analyzer
also bounds document size as an alias-amplification guard: at most **50
root selections** per operation and **2000 total selections** across the
whole document — over either limit the request is rejected (there is no
separate nesting-depth counter).

## Does not exist — do not invent

- Field type `number` → schema rejected; use `int`, `int64` or
  `float64` (the full type set is the table above — nothing else).
- Unknown schema keys → schema rejected listing the valid keys (e.g.
  `webhooks` instead of `hooks`, `secret` instead of `hmac_secret_env`).
  Nothing is silently ignored anymore.
- Writing a field the resource doesn't have → 422
  `{"error":"validation_failed","fields":[{"field":"…","rule":"unknown_field"}]}`
  (not a 500, not silently dropped).
- Hook events other than the four listed (no `on_create`, no
  `before_delete`/`after_delete`).
- Filter ops `neq`, `in`, `like`, `is_null` → 400.
- Multi-field sort or `sort=field:desc` → silently ignored.
- Total-count in list responses (`count=true` is not a thing).
- Declarative joins / FK constraints (`relation` only adds the
  subresource route).
- CORS headers — browser SPAs must be served same-origin
  ([workaround](docs/DEPLOY.md#cors--current-status-important-for-spas)).
- GraphQL `update` mutation.
- `default` values applied on insert, and `indexes` materialized as DB
  indexes — both keys parse but neither acts yet. A schema declaring
  `indexes` is accepted with
  `"warnings":["indexes … are parsed but not yet applied …"]` in the
  register/PUT response (and a boot log line), so the dead key is never
  blessed in silence.
- `workflows` schema block — parsed for forward compatibility, no executor.
- OTLP/OpenTelemetry export (observability is Prometheus `/metrics` + an
  internal trace ring).
- A hosted/SaaS version — self-hosted only.
