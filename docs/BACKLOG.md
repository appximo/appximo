# Appitools — the open-item register

**This file is the ONLY place an open item lives.** Not a chat report, not a
session summary, not somebody's memory. If work is left undone, it is written
here with a reason and a definition of "ready"; if it is decided against, it is
written here with a link to the ADR that says why.

Created by **LOOSE-ENDS-SWEEP-S1**, which swept every report, doc and ADR in the
repo (and in `/root/commerce`) and consolidated what it found. Before it, open
items were scattered across session reports and were re-litigated from memory
each time.

## How to use it

**Any session that leaves something undone adds a row.** An item has exactly one
of three states — there is no fourth, and "pending, we'll see" is not a state:

| State | Means |
|---|---|
| **OPEN** | Not done. Has an impact, and a **Ready** criterion precise enough that a future session knows when it is finished. |
| **CLOSED** | Decided against, with a written justification (an ADR or a documented note) **and** the condition under which it would be reconsidered. |
| **DONE** | Implemented and verified. Kept for one release cycle so the history is readable, then dropped. |

IDs are stable and never reused: `ENG-*` engine, `SCHEMA-*` schema grammar,
`RBAC-*` authorization, `OPS-*` operations/tooling, `DOC-*` documentation,
`COMMERCE-*` the commerce backend (a separate repo, tracked here because the
engine's roadmap depends on what building it revealed).

## OPEN

### ENG-1 — Embed cache for `?include=` relations
- **Origin:** ADR-019 §cache invalidation; carried in ESTADO_Y_PLAN_MAESTRO as
  "the only piece of relations not implemented".
- **Impact:** Medium. A nested read runs its LATERAL every time. Correct, and
  measured at +0.01 ms p50 for ~15 children, so this is throughput headroom on
  read-heavy embeds, not a defect.
- **Ready:** an embed result is cached per (tenant, parent-set, role) and
  INVALIDATED by a write to either the parent or the child resource; a stale
  embed is impossible after a write in the same tenant; benchmarked `no_change`
  on the non-embed path and a measured win on the embed path.

### ENG-2 — Zero-downtime binary upgrade
- **Origin:** PROD_PATH_AUDIT §1.2 ("Zero-downtime (binario) — no existe").
- **Impact:** Medium. `deploy-update.sh` does SIGTERM → wait → start, measured at
  **0.47 s** of 502s under live traffic (docs/BENCHMARKS.md). Acceptable for a
  single box; visible for an API with a strict SLO.
- **Ready:** a deploy costs **zero** failed requests under 500 rps, verified by
  the chaos suite. Candidates: socket hand-off (`SO_REUSEPORT`) between old and
  new process, or a symlink + blue/green pair behind the existing `/readyz` drain.

### ENG-3 — Restore command + scheduled backups
- **Origin:** PROD_PATH_AUDIT §1.5 / §2.8; docs/CAPABILITIES.md ("Backup has no
  restore command and no scheduling").
- **Impact:** **High for an operator.** `scripts/backup.sh` and
  `POST /admin/backup` produce dumps; nothing verifies one can be restored, and
  an unverified backup is not a backup.
- **Ready:** `appitools restore --tenant X --from <dump>` exists, a scheduled
  backup is part of the installer (a systemd timer), and a **restore drill** runs
  in `scripts/verify-production/` — dump, drop into a scratch database, restore,
  diff the row counts.

### ENG-4 — OTLP / OpenTelemetry export
- **Origin:** README "Known limits"; docs/CAPABILITIES.md.
- **Impact:** Low for the target user (the in-binary observability is the
  differentiator — ADR-020), blocking for anyone standardized on OTel.
- **Ready:** an opt-in exporter behind a build tag or config, with the hot path
  measured `no_change` when it is off (the reason it has not shipped: the SDK's
  weight must not reach the request path by default).

### SCHEMA-1 — Computed / derived fields
- **Origin:** docs/MODEL_LAB.md G7 ("order totals as a computed field").
- **Impact:** Medium. Totals, counts and balances are recomputed by the client or
  a handler; the aggregation endpoint (G3) covers the reporting case but not "a
  field on the row".
- **Ready:** a declarative computed field materializes as a generated column or a
  view-backed read, is validated at load (an expression grammar, not raw SQL —
  the same rule as SCHEMA-2), and never appears on the write path.

### SCHEMA-2 — Structured index predicates (partial indexes)
- **Origin:** commerce docs/GAPS.md #4; **decided in
  [ADR-022](adr/ADR-022-declarative-surface-boundaries.md) Decision 2**.
- **Impact:** Low-medium. A partial index today lives in the user's boot DDL
  (`Config.BeforeStart`), which works and is documented.
- **Ready:** a STRUCTURED predicate (`{"where": {"field","op","value"}}` — never
  raw SQL), validated at load, rendered through `pkg/schemadiff`, diffed by
  structure, and surviving an introspect→diff→apply cycle with an empty plan.

### SCHEMA-3 — Per-transition RBAC on state machines
- **Origin:** AGENTS.md §state machines "Out of scope (documented)"; **decided in
  [ADR-022](adr/ADR-022-declarative-surface-boundaries.md) Decision 3**.
- **Impact:** Medium for commerce/finance (who may refund vs who may ship). The
  documented pattern today — one custom route per privileged transition, granted
  by the `routes` block — covers it with a single authorization surface.
- **Ready:** enforced identically on REST, GraphQL **and** inside
  `POST /api/transaction`, expressible in Studio's state-machine designer and in
  the LLM grammar, benchmarked `no_change` on the update path.

### SCHEMA-4 — GraphQL keyset pagination
- **Origin:** docs/SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md §GraphQL ("no keyset cursors — a
  documented future increment").
- **Impact:** Low-medium. GraphQL forwards only `page`/`per_page` (OFFSET) while
  REST has keyset; a deep GraphQL page is slower than the same REST page.
- **Ready:** `after`/`before` on the GraphQL list args, mapped to the same keyset
  builder REST uses, with the offset path kept for compatibility.

### RBAC-1 — Read-scoped row-condition operators (`in`, `neq`, `is_null`)
- **Origin:** docs/SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md §7.7; **decided in
  [ADR-022](adr/ADR-022-declarative-surface-boundaries.md) Decision 1** — `eq`
  stays the only operator because the create path FORCES the condition value
  (the mass-assignment block), which only equality can mean.
- **Impact:** Low. Per-resource `permissions` and custom routes cover the cases
  seen so far.
- **Ready:** a real case that neither covers; then `in`/`neq`/`is_null` permitted
  **only** on actions listed in `condition_actions` that exclude `create`,
  type-validated at load, with negative tests and an ABBA benchmark.

### OPS-1 — A measurement box without CPU steal
- **Origin:** ESTADO_Y_PLAN_MAESTRO "DEUDA TÉCNICA CONOCIDA"; reconfirmed by
  LIBRARY-GAPS-S1 (a base-vs-base control measured a **±8 %** noise floor on the
  105) and again by this session.
- **Impact:** Medium for engineering confidence. Fine deltas (a few ns on the
  RBAC path) are unmeasurable here; the ABBA + control protocol works around it
  but costs a full extra arm every time.
- **Ready:** a dedicated box (or a pinned/isolated cgroup) where a base-vs-base
  control lands under ±2 %, wired into the bench protocol.

### OPS-2 — Statistical benchmark gate in CI
- **Origin:** ESTADO_Y_PLAN_MAESTRO FASE 4.
- **Impact:** Medium. Regressions are caught by hand today, per session.
- **Ready:** a push runs the protocol against a stable baseline and fails on a
  verdict of `CHANGED` beyond max(0.5 ms, 3 %). Depends on OPS-1.

### OPS-3 — `golangci-lint` in CI (and the errcheck policy)
- **Origin:** this session. CI runs `make fmt-check`, `go build`, `go vet` and
  the test suites — **not** `golangci-lint`, despite `make lint` existing.
- **Impact:** Low. The full run (installed and executed this session) reports
  **64** findings: **50 errcheck**, almost all `json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(...)`
  on an error response and `defer Close()` in tests — writing an error response
  has no recovery path, which is why the repo already annotates many of them
  `//nolint:errcheck`; plus 12 staticcheck style suggestions (`QF*`). The three
  substantive ones were **fixed this session** (an unused var, an ineffectual
  assignment, an empty branch).
- **Ready:** a `.golangci.yml` that encodes the decision (errcheck exempted for
  response-writing and test cleanup, or the sites annotated), the run under
  10 minutes on CI hardware, and the gate added to `ci.yml`. Not done now because
  annotating 50 sites is churn that would bury this session's diff.

### OPS-4 — The deployed binary is not traceable to a commit
- **Origin:** this session, while bootstrapping the admin account on the 58.
  `/health` reports `"version":"dev"` and `appitools version` says
  `commit unknown` — the live binary was built without the ldflags the canonical
  build (`scripts/build-engine.sh`) injects.
- **Impact:** Medium for operations. Nobody can tell from outside WHICH build is
  serving `api.appitools.com`, and the DevHub deploy pipeline's smoke check
  (`/health` version == pushed SHA) cannot pass, so a deploy's own verification
  step is degraded. It also makes a rollback decision guesswork.
- **Ready:** every path that produces a shipped binary (the installer's download,
  `deploy-update.sh`, the Docker image, a manual build documented in
  PRODUCTION.md) goes through `scripts/build-engine.sh`, and `/health` on the 58
  reports a real SHA. Related to the release tag (see "Requires Miguel" below).

### COMMERCE-1 — Credit notes (fiscally correct refunds)
- **Origin:** COMMERCE-CORE-S1 report; the DIAN interface (`docs/DIAN.md`).
- **Impact:** **High for a Colombian merchant.** A refund today reverses the
  payment and the stock but issues no *nota crédito* — the invoice stays as
  issued, so the tax record is wrong.
- **Ready:** an approved refund emits a credit note through the same outbox +
  issuer path an invoice uses, linked to the original invoice's CUFE, with the
  same at-least-once idempotency; verified in `verify-webhook.sh`.

### COMMERCE-2 — Tax categories per product
- **Origin:** COMMERCE-CORE-S1 report. IVA is hardcoded at 19 % in the checkout.
- **Impact:** Medium — product scope, not a defect. Wrong for exempt/excluded
  goods, which is most food retail.
- **Ready:** a tax category per product type resolving a rate at checkout, with
  exempt (0 %) and excluded (no tax) distinguished, and the reconciliation report
  broken down by rate.

### COMMERCE-3 — Shipping addresses in the checkout
- **Origin:** COMMERCE-CORE-S1 report. `direcciones` exists; the checkout does
  not take one and shipping is always 0.
- **Impact:** Medium — product scope. Blocks a real storefront, not the engine.
- **Ready:** the checkout accepts an address (new or existing), computes a
  shipping cost through a pluggable strategy, and includes it in the order total
  and the invoice.

### COMMERCE-4 — A real DIAN Proveedor Tecnológico adapter
- **Origin:** `docs/DIAN.md` (the interface exists; the implementation is a stub).
- **Impact:** High to go live in Colombia, zero for the engine.
- **Ready:** one PT implemented behind the existing `Issuer` interface, with
  sandbox credentials, the CUFE returned and stored, and the failure modes mapped
  to the `facturas` state machine.

## CLOSED (decided, with the reasoning written down)

| ID | Item | Decision & where it is justified |
|---|---|---|
| **RBAC-C1** | Join / subquery row conditions | **No.** Unbounded per-row cost inside the embed LATERAL, and an unauditable compiled policy. Denormalize the ownership column — [ADR-022](adr/ADR-022-declarative-surface-boundaries.md) Decision 1b. Reconsider if a case needs ownership through a relation AND the denormalized column is genuinely unmaintainable. |
| **SCHEMA-C1** | Raw-SQL index predicates | **No.** Arbitrary SQL rendered into DDL from a surface that `ai-generate` and Studio also write. (The previously-stated churn objection was measured and **retracted** — normalization is deterministic.) [ADR-022](adr/ADR-022-declarative-surface-boundaries.md) Decision 2. Reopens as SCHEMA-2 (structured form). |
| **SCHEMA-C2** | A `decimal`/`money` field type | **No.** `int64` in minor units is the industry representation and what payment APIs speak; a `numeric` would still reach a JSON client as a float, recreating the bug. Documented in AGENTS.md, SCHEMA_REFERENCE §3.2, BACKEND_SPEC §2 and the LLM grammar so generated schemas use it. Reconsider if a client needs exact decimals the JSON layer can carry (a string-typed money scalar). |
| **DOC-C1** | "The binary cannot serve a frontend" | **Fixed, not merely closed** — `Config.Static` ships (this session). Listed here because PROD_PATH_AUDIT §1.4 and PRODUCTION.md §6(c) both asserted it; both are corrected. |

---

## Requires a decision from Miguel (not technical blockers)

| Item | Why it needs him |
|---|---|
| **Cloudflare proxy on `api.appitools.com`** | It resolves to Cloudflare IPs (104.21.x / 172.67.x), which buys DDoS protection and caching but contaminates direct measurement — PROD-VERIFY-SUITE measured 9.75 ms through it vs 2.78 ms at the origin. Keep it and measure the origin directly, or drop it for the demo domain. |
| **Cut the first release tag** | `RELEASE_VERSION=""` in `scripts/install.sh` and zero `v*` tags, so the documented "download the binary from GitHub Releases" path cannot work yet, and OPS-4 (version traceability) partly depends on it. |
| **Rotate the 58's PostgreSQL password** | It was exposed in a session transcript on 2026-07-29 (a masking pattern that missed `DATABASE_URL`). Not known to be leaked further, but it is a live credential on a public box. `ALTER USER appitools WITH PASSWORD …` + update `/etc/appitools/appitools.env` + `systemctl restart appitools`. |

## DONE in LOOSE-ENDS-SWEEP-S1

| ID | Item | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| ENG-S1 | **`Config.Static`** — serve a frontend from the binary (root or sub-path, opt-in SPA fallback, immutable hashed assets, no tenant tx / RBAC / cache buffering, boot-checked against engine prefixes, traversal impossible by construction) | Unit tests incl. traversal + shadowing; live matrix against `examples/fullstack` (shell + assets + deep link served with no token, `/api` still 401, engine UIs intact) |
| ENG-S2 | **503 instead of 500 when the database cannot serve** (connection failures, SQLSTATE class 08/53, 57P01-03) + `Retry-After` | `pkg/db/unavailable_test.go` — 21 unavailable causes and 11 that must NOT be reclassified (40001/40P01 stay caller errors) |
| OPS-S1 | Stale ufw rules on the 58 (8080, 3000, from the retired NestJS benchmark) closed | `ufw status` now 22/80/443 only; `api.appitools.com` still 200 with a valid certificate; 8080 refused from outside |
| DOC-S1 | False claims corrected in ESTADO_Y_PLAN_MAESTRO (a dead droplet listed as live, "everything pushed" with commits queued, six shipped features listed as missing) | Each verified against reality before editing |
| OPS-S2 | A stale 46 MB binary from 13 Jun (commit `507f846`, predating the whole `/admin` API) sat in `/root/appitools/` on the 58, next to the git checkout — the obvious-looking one to run, and the wrong one | Verified nothing referenced it (systemd, cron, scripts) and that the live process's `/proc/PID/exe` pointed at `/opt/appitools/bin/appitools`; deleted the file only. Service kept the same PID; site still 200 |
| COMMERCE-S1 | **The reservation sweeper is scheduled** — an abandoned cart no longer holds stock forever | Live: a hold expired, swept within one tick, `stock_reservado` 3 → 0, reservation `liberada`, logged |
